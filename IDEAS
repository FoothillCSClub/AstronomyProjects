Some Ideas For Astronomy-Related Projects
=========================================

These were culled from a list emailed to me by Geoff Mathews
<[mathewsgeoff@fhda.edu](mailto:mathewsgeoff@fhda.edu)>

* exoplanet exaggerator - read data on known exoplanets and present an
  exaggerated "by eye" view; this would show the patch of sky with the
  star and make it visibly flicker (real transits cause changes in
  brightness at the 0.01% level...), and for systems with a measured
  doppler shift, exaggerated blue and redshift of the star.  There are a
  few modified versions of this I can think of, too - for example, line
  up several stars side by side for comparison  

* exoplanet simulator - the user has sliders to adjust observed
  inclination, stellar mass, planet mass, size, and orbital distance,
  and the simulator generates a lightcurve, velocity curve, , and (if
  the exaggerator exists) exaggerated view of the star.  Similar to the
  following two tools, but having the option of seeing the full
  light-curve over time (not just the simulation of a single transit)
  and with the radial velocity simulator, having the option of showing
  an exaggerated wobble of the star

* exoplanet magic zoom view - see a magically zoomed in view of an
  exoplanet system, both the view from Earth and a "top-down" view with
  exaggerated stellar wobble.  This would be great to pair with a
  representation of the lightcurve and velocity curve.  

* spiral galaxy dark matter simulator - make a simple galaxy with stars
  arranged in a disk with circular orbits, and have an interface for
  adjusting the dark matter distribution and see the resulting velocity
  curve

* intermediate complexity atmosphere simulator - pro-tools are too
  complex for basic teaching, but existing simple models don't include
  tie-ins to spectroscopy.  It would be great to have a simplified
  atmosphere model that would allow users to adjust CO2 and H2O levels,
  see the resulting atmospheric absorption spectrum and temperature

The exoplanet tools were all inspired by:

[http://astro.unl.edu/naap/esp/animations/radialVelocitySimulator.html](http://astro.unl.edu/naap/esp/animations/radialVelocitySimulator.html)  
but these lack a few useful aspects and combinations  

If you have any questions about the above, please contact Geoff

If you want to take on one of these projects, please let Geoff know, and
make a commit to this file noting that you're working on the project
(talk to me and I'll give you push access to the repo).
